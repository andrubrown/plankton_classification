## Plankton image classification

This repo contains scripts for the Kaggle National Data Science Bowl competition ([1]),
where the objective was to develop an algorithm to predict the probability that a given image
belongs to one of 121 different classes, most of which are varieties of plankton.
Multiclass log loss was used for evaluation.
